# MF DOOM Album API
An API that serves data about the albums made my recording artist MF DOOM. 

**Link to project:** https://mfdoom.onrender.com

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express

Built server using Javascript, Node.js and Express. HTML and CSS for the landing page displaying API endpoint and example JSON output.

## Optimizations:

If I had more time I would add more data to the API, like collaboration albums and album artwork. I would also add more styling to the main page.

## Lessons Learned:

Using Express and Node.js to build a back end CRUD server.
